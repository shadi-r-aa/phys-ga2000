\maketitle

\abstract{This is Shadi's LaTeX PS1 submission for Professor Blanton's Computational Physics first problem set during Fall 2023. My GitHub account name is shadi-r-aa.}

\section{Computing background}
\label{sec:bg}
I have coded minimally during college, and the most I have done is produce pretty plots for some of my papers using Mathematica.

\section{Goals}
\label{sec:gl}

 I am looking forward to learning more about computing, especially since I am interested in complexity classes and would like to understand them at a deeper level. I would also like to get better at numerical integration and simulations, as many times in my research, it is almost impossible to get an analytic expression for some problems.

\section{Plans}
My future plan, for now, is to remain in academia. 
\section{Gaussian plot}
